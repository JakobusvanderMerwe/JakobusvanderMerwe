# Jakobus van der Merwe GitHub Profile

Welcome to my public profile! This includes examples and certificates of my current journey in learning how to become a software developer, with zero previous experience. 

Im currently working on understanding the basics of software development.
Im currently learning from a site called Learn Enough (by Hartle) - the courses have been great for someone that has no prior experience.
I'm looking for help to obtain an official certificate from a recognized institute - any suggestions?
You can reach me on vandermerwej06@gmail.com

Check out my progress so far:
